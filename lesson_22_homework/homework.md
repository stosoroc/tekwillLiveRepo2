# Homework

Given the data in the [file](homework.xlsx). Do the following.

Create a program that will allow us to see the following information.

* Rows where the score is missing, i.e. is NaN
* Rows the score is between **a** and **b**, where a and b are values input from console.
* Rows sorted by score
* Rows sorted by name

And do the following operations:

* Add new element (result) to the dataframe (values input from console)
* Remove results from the dataframe (by index)
* Save a list of all students that qualified, in a separate Excel file called `qualified_students.xlsx`. Only columns
  _name_ and _score_ should be visible there.
